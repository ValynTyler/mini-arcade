# Mini Arcade python source
A reimplementation of my old, unusable miniarcade code.
## Tech
Mini Arcade uses the python library pygame. Pygame is an SDL wrapper that allows simple 2D games to be developed. Pygame was chosen initially as it was the most popular game framework for python, the recommended language for working with the target hardware- a raspberry pi.
> Note that pygame requires execution on the main thread, so concurrency should be approached with that in mind.
